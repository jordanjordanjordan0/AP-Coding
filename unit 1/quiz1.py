1 - The difference between a linear and a binary search is that a linear search goes through the array going value by value finding its target. binary search breaks the value down the middle from lower or higher to find its target.

2 - listA = [10,24,34,35,67,98,101] using a linear search it would take six steps before it reaches its target.

3 - listB = [1,40, 44, 55, 70, 93, 99, 134, 145, 150, 200, 244] A binary search would break the array in half. Being that the number is higher than the half number 99 it would search the higher values. So in total it would be 5 total steps to reach the target 150

4 - An algorithm helps solve complex problems and is the fundmental part of a computer
